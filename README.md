# calc-textbook

This document is my version of a calculus textbook. It covers all topics from the basics of Calculus I (the concept of a limit) to multivariable calculus, or the equivalent of Calc IV in most American universities. The organization of the textbook is loosely inspired by the textbook I used in high school - Stewart: _Calculus_, 8th edition.

The goal of the document is twofold: 1. To provide all the information and concepts (and way more!) located in any university calculus textbook, but at a fraction of the length, and 2. To be concise enough, and include sufficient practice material, so as to be used as a study guide.

Calculus is many students' first introduction to a rigorous, formal math class. As such, I consider proofs extremely important when learning calculus, and have included many proofs of the most important theorems and other results. For those who find proofs a little difficult to follow, I also use the word "intuitively" quite often throughout this document. This is one of the key ideas in this book: train your intuition, and to use it as a tool to help you understand calculus. We can often use our intuition to get an informal sense of a concept, and comparing intuition with the formal results often brings great insight. (There will be times where our intuition is completely wrong, and that's ok!)

I have also written, from scratch, every single example in this document. Examples are an extension of the actual "textbook" itself: I consider problem solving to be as important as understanding the concepts, if not more so. To that goal, every example has a specific purpose - whether that is to point out a specific pitfall, or multiple examples of a phenomena, or to illustrate how small changes to the problem lead to large changes in the solution, etc, etc. Pay special attention to the problems!

So far, I have written the content for Chapters 1-3, convering up to the basic differentiation rules. (5/24/22)
